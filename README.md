# Greasemonkey Outlook Adblock Fix

## What it does
You know all those ugly and annoying prompts to stop using adblock on the right side of the screen?
And that little "Get Premium" button on the bottom left?

Well with this little blocking script you won't have to look at them ever again, and you'll get the added bonus of freeing up some 
screen real-estate!

## Installation
* Install GreaseMonkey
* Add this script as a new user script under GreaseMonkey options
* Profit?
